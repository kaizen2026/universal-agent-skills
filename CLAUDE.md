Universal Agent Skills is an MIT-licensed derivative of `mattpocock/skills`, preserving upstream history and attribution while adding frontend design and continuity workflows.

For ongoing adviser/worker coordination and low-cost monitoring work, read [the agreed design and working notes](./docs/plans/advisor-worker-coordination.md) before continuing. Keep that record current at meaningful boundaries, separating agreed decisions, proposed work, and verified results. It is a context record, not blanket permission to launch agents, alter host settings, commit, or push.

Skills are organized into bucket folders under `skills/`:

- `engineering/` — daily code work
- `productivity/` — daily non-code workflow tools
- `misc/` — kept around but rarely used, not promoted
- `in-progress/` — beta: public on purpose, feedback wanted, not shipped in the plugin
- `deprecated/` — no longer used

Every skill in `engineering/` or `productivity/` (the **promoted** buckets) must have a reference in the top-level `README.md` and an entry in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s `skills` array (the Claude Code plugin ships exactly the promoted set). Skills in `misc/`, `in-progress/`, and `deprecated/` must not appear in either.

Install commands are copied verbatim from [.agents/install-block.md](./.agents/install-block.md). `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` provides the optional direct Claude Code marketplace path. Run `claude plugin validate . --strict` after touching either manifest. The derivative distribution decision lives in [.agents/adr/0003-universal-distribution-and-host-adapters.md](./.agents/adr/0003-universal-distribution-and-host-adapters.md); ADR 0002 remains upstream history.

Each skill entry in the top-level `README.md` must link the skill name to its `SKILL.md`.

Each bucket folder has a `README.md` that lists every skill in the bucket with a one-line description, with the skill name linked to its `SKILL.md`. The promoted buckets' `README.md`s and the top-level `README.md` group entries into **User-invoked** and **Model-invoked**; non-promoted bucket `README.md`s (`misc/`, `in-progress/`) use a flat list.

Skills in `engineering/` and `productivity/` also have a human-facing docs page at `docs/<bucket>/<skill-name>.md` (the docs tree mirrors those two bucket folders under `skills/`). These repository docs are the canonical maintained pages for this derivative; retained upstream pages may still link to upstream background material. When you add, rename, or change the behaviour of a promoted skill, create or re-sync its docs page following [.agents/writing-docs.md](./.agents/writing-docs.md). A finished page carries four sections — **What it does**, **When to reach for it**, **Common questions**, **It's working if** — and `writing-docs.md` holds the template, section order, and source policy. Skills in the non-promoted buckets (`misc/`, `in-progress/`, `deprecated/`) get **no** docs page.

Every `SKILL.md` is either user-invoked (`disable-model-invocation: true` plus `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` in `agents/openai.yaml`, reachable only by the human) or model-invoked (model- or user-reachable). See [.agents/invocation.md](./.agents/invocation.md).

[`ask-matt`](./skills/engineering/ask-matt/SKILL.md) is the retained upstream router that maps every user-reachable skill and how they relate. The same trigger that re-syncs a docs page applies to it: whenever you add, rename, remove, or change how a user-reachable skill fits the flows, re-read `ask-matt`'s `SKILL.md` and update it so the map stays accurate — a new skill it never mentions, or a stale one it still routes to, is a router that lies.

To (re)link every skill into the local harness skill directories (`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`), run `scripts/link-skills.sh`. Each entry is a symlink into this repo, so a `git pull` keeps installed skills current; re-run the script after adding, removing, or renaming a skill.

For issue publication, triage, blocking relationships, or implementation work, read [the pinned GitHub issue-tracker contract](./docs/agents/issue-tracker.md) and [the triage-role mapping](./docs/agents/triage-labels.md) before the first tracker operation.
